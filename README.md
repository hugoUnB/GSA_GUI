# GSA_GUI
The GSA methods is used to fit functions in experimental data.
It is based on the correlation between the minimization of a cost function (or objective) obtained through a slow cooling.
In this method, an artificial temperature is introduced and gradually cooled in complete analogy with the well known annealing technique, frequently used in metallurgy when a molten metal reaches its crystalline state (global minimum of the thermodynamics energy).
In our case the temperature is intended as an external noise
